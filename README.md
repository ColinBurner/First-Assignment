# Horiseon Social Solution Services HTML and CSS code cleanup with accessability features
Symantic HTML usage, CSS code cleanup and consolidation. 

## What I did to accomplish goals in this project
I adjusted or "cleaned up" the HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon Social Solution Services webpage in order to simplify it and make future edits easier. Specifically following symantic HTML guidelines to follow accessibility standards and guidelines. I used semantic HTML elements to better define the sections of the HTML code and create a more accessible webpage. I used id and class selectors in CSS to group previously ungrouped but same end goal items in an attempt to clean up the code.

## How I accomplished my goals with this project
This webpage is designed for use on a computer but will function on other platforms. I removed all div containers and replaced them with appropriate symantic HTML elements such as section. figure, aside, article, and header. I then used these symantic elements in CSS to cut down on excess code by grouping like elements together with class selectors and using id selectors for unique individual items. The style sheet went from 200 lines of code down to 149 lines in an attempt to "leave the code a little cleaner than I found it." The Search Engine Optimization link on the header now functions as it should, bringing you down to the SEO section of the webpage through correcting the HTML code to follow symantic guidelines for greater accessibility.
